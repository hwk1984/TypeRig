# TypeRig
TypeRig (root\Lib\) is a Python library aimed at simplifying (to some extent) the current FontLab VI API while offering some additional functionality that is heavily biased towards a simultaneous multi-layered workflow.

TypeRig GUI (root\GUI\) is a collecton of GUI centered tools representing functionality found in the library. Currently there reside:
- TypeRig Panel - a floating side panel with various tools. New tools will be added to on plugin-basis by just dropping the updated or new tabs as .py files in (root\GUI\Panel\Panel)

### Installation
Unpack files anywhere you want. Then:
- TypeRig Module - Run the provided install.py, it will create link/path to Python Site packages. Please note that if you change the location of the installtion you should run the script again.

- TypeRig GUI - Please refer to Fontlab VI manual about "Scripting Panel" section "Open the List of scripts" (http://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/Scripting-panel/)

### Documenation
A fresh copy of the current master API could be obtained here (as a pydoc dump) as well as using python's help(...) function.

### Developer
TypeRig FDK is developed by Vassil Kateliev (2017).
