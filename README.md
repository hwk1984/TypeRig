# TypeRig
TypeRig FDK Font Development Kit is a collection of Python libraries aimed at simplifying (to some extent) the current FontLab VI API while offering some additional functionality that is heavily biased towards a simultaneous multi-layered multiple-master workflow.

### Documenation
A fresh copy of the current master API could be obtained here (as a pydoc dump) as well as using python's help(...) function.

### Developer(s)
TypeRig FDK is developed by Vassil Kateliev (2017).
